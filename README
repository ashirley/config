Some of my config files.

These are here for 2 reasons:
1. I find browsing other peoples' config/dot files helpful
2. I tried this in svn but it worked horribly, I hope git will be better and if so will think about moving other things onto it.

== zshrc
* Install Oh My Zsh! - sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
* Install powerlevel10k: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/README.md#oh-my-zsh
* --Install DejaVuSansMono from Nerd fonts: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest--
* Install p10k font (may be automatic in iterm2) - https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/README.md#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k
* If using ConEmu, set the font (twice) in the settings.

This uses git submodules so after cloning, run `git submodule init; git submodule update --recursive --remote`
